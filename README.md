# README for ar-vr-portfolio-project #
## A repo made for the final project during the AR/VR Specialization ##

Welcome to my prototype of `Rage Out!`. It is a rage room that takes place in VR.
I currently have plans to turn this into a full game post my graduation at Holberton School.

I made all the asset models in Blender, which I learned during the time alloted for the creation of this project.
This was done through the help of tutorials found for free on Youtube and with the help of some Googling.
